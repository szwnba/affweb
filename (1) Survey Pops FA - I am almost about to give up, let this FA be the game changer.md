Hi Affliftians (how do you think about this name for our community members? ), I finally decide to do a FA now, the reasons being:  
1\. I have been around this community for quite some time, although only recently I got quite serious about taking advantage of the membership to learn about affiliate marketing. So I read the famous [intermediate](https://afflift.com/f/threads/new-course-survey-pops-the-intermediate-guide.7486/) [Survey pops](https://afflift.com/f/forums/survey-pops/) guide and try to do the campaign accordingly (again, last time I somehow quit half way), after a few rounds, I got better results but still in red. But I lose confidence already or a bit unsure about how to continue fine tuning the campaign. So when [@Affyou](https://afflift.com/f/members/2924/) suggested I should start a FA when in Red instead of in Green, I merrily accepted the idea and take action here.

2\. Definitely I want it to be green ASAP, but I need help or advice from our expert community members. So please be generous on your advice and tips.

3\. I want to also share some of my obstacles and learnings along the way so that some of our community freshmen can benefit from it.

Ok, without further ado, let's talk about the campaign.

 **![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/6.6/png/unicode/64/1f3af.png)
 [Traffic Source](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/categories/traffic-sources.1/): [Propeller Ads](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/propellerads.11/)  
![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/6.6/png/unicode/64/1f527.png)
 Tracking Tool: [BeMob](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/bemob.15/)  
![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/6.6/png/unicode/64/2705.png)
 Affiliate Network: [Zeydoo](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/zeydoo.121/)  
![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/6.6/png/unicode/64/1f44d.png)
 Type of Offer: Surveys  
![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/6.6/png/unicode/64/1f4b0.png)
 Offer Payout: varies**

As you can see, I strictly follow [@Nick](https://afflift.com/f/members/1106/) 's [Survey Pops - The Intermediate Guide](https://afflift.com/f/forums/survey-pops/), as my knowledge is too limited to do any modification at the moment.

I will first post the first few versions that I did in the past few days and some notes I gained along the way.  
Then I should try to improve/fine tune the campaign based on that on a daily basis and post the results as well on daily basis.  
My goal is to turn the campain into green one consistently in a month. (2022 - 09 - 30 to 2022 - 10 - 30)

Not a very ambitious goal, but for a guy who had lingered in the edge of the affiliate marketing field for more than 10 years but never earned some decent monty, it's a BIG Goal.

Let this FA be the game changer for me!

In fact I changed my [propellerads](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/propellerads-pops.1/) country to some top countries that my [zeydoo](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/zeydoo.121/) AM told me, then I relaunched the campaign.  
so my first campaign with conversions has the following parameters:

1\. I have no experience in building landing pages, so I did it with direct linking.

2\. I changed my propellerAds country to some top countries.

the result? not as satisfactory as I expected. it's shown below:

These survey offers are getting harder and harder to get good performance out of (based on the things I'm reading here on affLIFT). Creating your own prelander seems to be key in getting them profitable. So, I would not direct link them anymore or I think you will continue to see these results.

> 1\. I have no experience in building landing pages, so I did it with direct linking.

You should focus on this imo. Check out our guide here:

### [Landing Pages 101](https://afflift.com/f/threads/landing-pages-101.8005/)

Why landing pages are valuable to you as a media buyer, how you can get started using them, and I'll also show you a few popular examples to get you off to a good start.

 ![](https://afflift.com/f/styles/default/xenforo/favicon.png) afflift.com

If you want to continue to direct link, then I would try other top offers on [Zeydoo](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/zeydoo.121/) and other [affiliate networks](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/categories/affiliate-networks.10/). [Mobidea](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/mobidea.78/) gives you access to some great data as well as [Monetizer](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/monetizer.105/).

the next changes are :

1\. I managed to add some landing pages from below thread after some changes.

![](https://afflift.com/f/attachments/landing-ripper-purelander-png.24300/)

2\. I managed to choose some zone ids based on ROI ranking, I learned the skill from the below thread:

![](https://afflift.com/f/attachments/untitled-png.20672/)

the result was improved over the previous version, but still far away from **Green!**

Okay, I'll be interested to see how your landing pages go. Make sure you have [back button](https://afflift.com/f/threads/the-back-button-script-guide.8283/) and push notification collection going ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/6.6/png/unicode/64/1f44d.png)

Fast forward to yesterday, I made the following changes (for both V3 and v4 of my campaign):  
1\. Remove offer survey-light as roi is -48.383%, while the other one is -40%

2\. Remove landing LP9, as ROI is -57%, while others are -40, -41, -37

3\. keep 6 countries according CR ranking;

4\. keep 6 zones only according ROI ranking;

the result is improving a bit, but I noticed that the traffic came at lower speed, which could be normal as I restricted the traffic a lot: 6 countries and 6 zones only.

see below today's result:

What should I do next? or probably should run the campaign for 2 more days?  
Fee a bit halt now, need your tips and advice.

Are any of the countries and zones profitable? It's very hard to give any advice with very little data that is apparently from multiple days lol

ok sure, I will study the back button stuff and try to use it in next modification.  
but push notification collection ? how to use that?

Push collection allows you to monetize people on your landing pages in addition to them converting on your offers. The two most popular companies in the forum are [ProPush](https://afflift.com/f/articles/propush-review-easy-money-or-waste-of-time.156/) (#1) and [Monetizer](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/monetizer.105/) (#2) based on the feedback I've seen. There are many others though and you can search the forum for "collection" to find some more.

I recommend signing up and ProPush and Monetizer and then reading through these:

As Luke mentioned, having a [Propush](https://afflift.com/f/articles/propush-review-easy-money-or-waste-of-time.156/) revenue with these types of offers is essential, you will have a hard time trying to reach profit if you don't have additional revenue from [back button](https://afflift.com/f/threads/the-back-button-script-guide.8283/) and push.

Also once you find some good zones, you might end up like this:

for one of the campaigns(v3), got 2 countries and 1 zone profitable, please see below:

I don't know what to say about these survey offers anymore and the afflift guide... Don't forget it's a 1 year old guide, which in affiliate marketing it's like 5 years... I've spent and lost thousands on these to make it work but never reached green... You won't find any follow along or case study on the forum that's profitable in the long term like its said in the course ("these can work for months")

I do agree that it's good to learn the landing page basics, scripts to use etc. but nothing else.  
In my opinion AND experience we need to look at this course just like we look at the Pops guide, just to get an idea on how things work and then apply it with other offers/networks/[traffic sources](https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/categories/traffic-sources.1/).

Hey, hope your campaigns are going good. One tip for building posts/thread. It is better in my eyes to insert the images into your post.  
So all can see your pictures in your posts instead of the need to click them.

![](https://afflift.com/f/attachments/addimage-png.31047/)

use this button to insert pics inside your posts

just my opinion. It makes more fun to read a post then.

LOL , you are the creator and that's the only one I've heard about... BUT what about the thousands of members who tried to make it work?
