He’s very busy in his line work and it won’t be getting any easier. Outside of that, he also has big dreams for his future with his wife. Let me share the exact words he wrote us before he went through our materials:</p><p id="9d964510-e8c5-4ddd-85e6-9ae9815e73a9" class=""><em>“I have a big transition in my job coming up, so the next 5 years will be about settling into my career while also keeping the door open on the niches available to me so I can maintain the career I love and avoid burnout. Hopefully in 10 years my wife and I will have a couple of children, purchased our first house (finally), paid down our student loans, and maintained financial stability enough that we can still afford the travel we both love. We plan on doing a yearly review together, focusing on the future and the coming 1, 5, and 10 years together.”</em></p><p id="55d58581-357d-4efd-9b52-f08bbf3abd31" class="">Just like the other students, when you get overwhelmed by all the things we need to do it’s easy to lose focus on what’s important. Tanner was struggling with this himself.</p><p id="a3f9ba44-7662-4a4e-b270-34824d615b7c" class="">After going through our exercises he found clarity and he knew what he needed to focus on. He wrote:</p><p id="27e80b2d-b584-43cf-b956-16715cd44e10" class=""><em>“My 80/20 exercise is going to be some paperwork/forms that have been pending in my inbox for several weeks.

Software Engineer Started to Walk Every Morning for 15 Minutes</h2><p id="b1e83bb9-2154-4a40-b516-47a5bcbe08f8" class="">When we were doing customer research for our course on habits, one of the questions we asked them was:</p><p id="96b94008-bae0-4b4f-bb9b-dc294c2308ed" class="">“What’s one habit you wish you had?”</p><p id="2e80d01b-9273-48a9-a71e-aaa452a577f8" class="">The top answer surprised me: walking every morning.</p><p id="26660d3f-fb94-4c0e-8a76-5ddf0d8e421d" class="">Some cited it for health reasons, others for creativity purposes. So we kept digging deeper on why people didn’t walk every morning. You would think it’s really simple to do so why weren’t people doing it.</p><p id="50cd5c44-2334-4e60-a28e-e7579d4771d9" class="">That’s where a lot of interesting insights came in.</p><p id="7f2b661c-3bee-46f7-b8e5-929425303c3d" class="">I can’t share what this is because it’s something our competition would love to know (and something they aren’t able to discover).</p><p id="b8ef38d0-4a03-43a9-b891-ab0cd53a8d03" class="">Just kidding. I’ll share it with you.</p><p id="97971569-4123-4408-9ece-d9b083669f28" class="">There were two reasons why people didn’t walk every morning:</p><p id="8c2b50fd-08a1-4305-8c71-9afd68094eda" class="">1. Bad, unpredictable weather can hold people back from walking consistently
 2. “I can’t find the time to do it”</p><p id="57394156-cdab-44c8-818e-3021982370a5" class="">The first one is a viable excuse. If it’s raining or snowing, I can understand why you wouldn’t walk (especially at an older age). It’s not just the weather that’s the main problem. It’s when someone skips a day, it’s easy for them to skip another day (even when it’s nice weather outside).</p><p id="408290db-2b61-4e7a-b70e-47c9d6c41f40" class="">Once you skip a day, it’s easy to keep skipping until you never get back into your old habit.</p><p id="786a15d4-c3eb-4dde-b23b-eea250d6e436" class="">We have a separate solution for this that’s covered inside our Rituals course.</p><p id="8067b1b5-4035-4db5-9b5f-f54498dc2b0f" class="">The second excuse is an interesting one that I hear all the time: “I can’t find the time to do it”.</p><p id="d04aa603-00e9-4ef1-bc87-4dd352dea092" class="">I’ll spare you a 1,500-word rant on this.

Literally. Instead of doing crazy workout programs, he committed to walking more. He sent in a screenshot of his app that tracks his exercise:</p><p id="df6ad65f-b19b-4384-af23-5109ca6771a6" class="">Notice how he started with walking and then added in running and an elliptical machine. That’s the power of momentum. Once you have momentum, it’s really easy to add more things. The hardest part is to get started but once you focus and start, it’s easy to maintain and follow through.</p><p id="e4da140f-0863-4dcc-aca1-75a6bf4f6d3a" class="">Great job Elmer! Keep it going.

What if you focus on something but in the back of your head you’re not sure if it’s the right thing to focus on? Well…guess what happens. You can’t achieve deep work when you have that doubt lingering around.</p><p id="24ff7b9d-572b-49ef-afcb-bcc3d2e35df9" class="">That’s why we always work on finding clarity first and then teach people the focus skills they need.

She’s working on finishing her PhD which requires a lot of research, reading, and writing. All the files related to her goal are on the top half of the screen and notice how she put a movie in the not-urgent &amp; not-important box.</p><figure id="4af91326-0dc4-4223-8742-e46ebe3a68ab" class="image"><a href="5%20%E7%BB%88%E4%BA%8E%E9%9B%86%E4%B8%AD%E7%B2%BE%E5%8A%9B%E5%B9%B6%E5%AE%8C%E6%88%90%E4%BB%BB%E5%8A%A1%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%20-%20%E4%BA%9A%E6%B4%B2%E6%95%88%E7%8E%87%202446f711f6b44c5b9e457bba40b7f34c/submission-640x400.png"><img style="width:640px" src="5%20%E7%BB%88%E4%BA%8E%E9%9B%86%E4%B8%AD%E7%B2%BE%E5%8A%9B%E5%B9%B6%E5%AE%8C%E6%88%90%E4%BB%BB%E5%8A%A1%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%20-%20%E4%BA%9A%E6%B4%B2%E6%95%88%E7%8E%87%202446f711f6b44c5b9e457bba40b7f34c/submission-640x400.png"/></a></figure><p id="6cc13f75-875a-4808-9946-fec8d62e4345" class="">Here’s what she wrote us:</p><blockquote id="5c135b75-5d35-4ce1-a79c-225931535cb5" class="">Dear Asian Efficiency team,<p id="ccda45ad-7dad-4cbb-ab09-be64ce943b68" class="">I am always looking out for the next great idea or simplifier or just experiences of people smarter than me that can allow me to leapfrog through the trial-and-error part, and the contents of 5Day Focus Challenge packed a bunch of those!

This is what she wrote:</p><blockquote id="315e3f79-37c1-4f6e-9b7b-cc047343684c" class="">I use the desktop to sort through the subset activities of these goals placed in a folder. For example, I put that day’s journal article to read in the “Do First” green square, while I put away my travel blog documents in “Schedule” blue square to figure out specific deadlines for later.<p id="38bee512-efab-484b-988c-ee4fac4dab9f" class="">In “Delegate” I have some PowerPoint slides that I will ask someone to make into a prezi. In the “Don’t Do” section, I have the movie “A Bear Named Winnie” that I keep watching in pieces on repeat.</p><p id="b6d897e1-e1f3-4535-999c-aaa639694cca" class="">I also had four items there that I recognized later as “prestige goals” that actually did not align with what I value (or just enough to spend time and effort required) but was recognized widely as cool and hip in my friends circles such as learning how to take great foodie photos or diy basket-weaving. I had since removed them completely from my goals and schedules.</p><p id="2490a71d-9aee-41f2-af5a-ecd9daad6bec" class="">This is by no means a perfect system, but it really does help. I think it is especially beneficial for people who want to try to do everything with the “Don’t do” and “Delegate” squares.</p></blockquote><p id="49121b4b-a9c2-4489-b25d-ce7ae41646ac" class="">Sometimes knowing what NOT to do is just as valuable as knowing what to do.
