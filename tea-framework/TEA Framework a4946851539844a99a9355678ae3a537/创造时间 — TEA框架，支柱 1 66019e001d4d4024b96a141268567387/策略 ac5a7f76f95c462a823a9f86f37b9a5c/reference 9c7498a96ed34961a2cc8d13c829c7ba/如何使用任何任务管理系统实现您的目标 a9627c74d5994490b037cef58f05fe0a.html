So, how do you choose? Do you make a choice based on the cost of the tool? Do you make a comparison chart for all of the features each tool offers? Those things are important to consider, but the most important criteria for any tool is to know if it fits the way you think and work. In other words, <strong>“Will you actually use it?”</strong></p><p id="27511af1-e611-47e2-a077-a4e57b400255" class="">I have a friend who has an expensive piece of exercise equipment.

Understanding some task management basic principles will go a long way in deciding which task management system to use.</p><h3 id="1acd2480-396b-42b5-be0b-7297461fa537" class="">What is a Task?</h3><p id="04da40ab-a42e-4d54-a1bb-debd90ba99bc" class="">Simply put, a task is something that you need to get done. It is something small that you can not just work on but actually complete in a short period of time. It gives you the satisfaction of completing the entire unit of work because the scope is so limited. For example, writing this article included several tasks:</p><ul id="f9071162-8dbb-4027-8c09-23db6d6158ed" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Outlining the article</li></ul><ul id="fa472e5a-a95f-420a-a6c7-309e52da8f08" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Writing the first draft</li></ul><ul id="c5170d64-ddf1-41a3-a879-277c4460c833" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Selecting the images</li></ul><ul id="85a09b73-393d-42d2-a67f-e2e7b1a04f97" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Having someone else review the article</li></ul><ul id="61832e96-0212-46a3-8b15-7d37fd08252e" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Publishing the final article on the blog</li></ul><p id="4cb648ad-5e04-426c-a3c3-837c3c502e78" class="">All of these steps were individual tasks which were part of a bigger project. I didn’t complete them all at once or even all in the same day. And because I broke them down into smaller work units, it was easier for me to get started on them.</p><p id="9af63edd-145c-4295-a0e7-83373415a226" class="">Sometimes tasks will appear as items on a list. For example, your grocery list is actually a task list:</p><ul id="869b72e0-d4b6-4e35-9e1b-4b7155eff4c7" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Apples</li></ul><ul id="58b3f2f3-55e8-4534-9c28-fd1eeede2faa" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Oranges</li></ul><ul id="938dd4f5-37a0-4167-94ff-b0c4353620fb" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Bread</li></ul><ul id="fbce8514-eb7e-4e8c-a77d-d0fe829594d8" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Lunch Meat</li></ul><ul id="d91f43ca-2b60-4f91-be01-ef8dd9cac713" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Cereal</li></ul><ul id="4d0e2b82-6c47-45a3-a8f7-6948e4a238ad" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Milk</li></ul><ul id="40b4c1c1-3a28-4020-aeb0-5c8697db3cf4" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Orange Juice</li></ul><ul id="10f78f46-6d95-4217-b674-76b141e9ee4e" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">etc.</li></ul><p id="6cddbeff-6e0a-4d8d-b84d-86b09bca1f3e" class="">These are all tasks that you must complete once you get to the store.

You’re already familiar with the concept of task management, even if you didn’t know it.</p><p id="efeeebe1-e1c5-4794-9bcf-c457d06ebcb3" class="">But there are a couple of things that are <em>NOT</em> tasks:</p><ul id="12310be8-172c-49df-baf5-8d379ddc9a2a" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Appointments</li></ul><ul id="60ef5615-e134-4b5e-bab5-830e6277e4a4" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Meetings</li></ul><p id="79e30560-a851-4c98-a0f4-f42c3ecdd85a" class="">Both of these are events, not tasks. You should manage your events in your “event manager” (commonly called a <em>calendar</em>, check out <a href="https://www.asianefficiency.com/schedule-management/7-tips-calendar/">this post</a> for more calendar management tips).</p><p id="0143e247-b71d-4c2d-b088-3a02317aa8c7" class="">Everything else you need to do is either a task or a project.</p><h3 id="a73a0338-e72a-419f-bf78-f19ad9013046" class="">What is the difference between a list and a project?</h3><p id="ec8fa348-9bf5-4231-a655-a7678ff3d467" class="">In the previous section, I shared two examples: 1) writing this article, and 2) a grocery list. Both of these examples contain tasks, but not both of them are projects. The article is a <em>project</em>, but the grocery items are a <em>list</em>. A list <em>can</em> be a project (and in some task managers they are even called projects), but there’s a basic difference here:</p><ul id="c13ca569-0ddd-4690-a229-418f222e62b3" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">A <strong>list</strong> is a set of loosely related tasks that has <em>no</em> specific end date.</li></ul><ul id="75f956bd-2910-4442-bad4-3569c4ab4f98" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">A <strong>project</strong> is a set of closely related tasks that <em>has</em> a specific outcome and a specific end date.</li></ul><p id="ff3ca5de-e421-4a55-9e88-446539ffc2b1" class="">The grocery list doesn’t have to be completed by a specific day or time. It’s just a list of things you <em>should</em> get the next time you go to the store. The article is a project that <em>must</em> be finished by a specific publish date.</p><p id="bc923f54-44f8-4bfd-947a-b9295c123942" class="">There are two different types of projects:</p><ul id="1c33246b-c37d-41d7-a4a4-f848e31184ce" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Sequential</strong> – These are projects that have tasks that must be completed in a specific order.</li></ul><ul id="4bbc7e2c-63a7-4b71-ba6f-1963a9a6b914" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Parallel</strong> – These are projects with tasks that don’t need to be done in a specific order (they can all be worked on at the same time).</li></ul><p id="5c93b997-f9c6-45a6-978c-909d4dde1d5d" class="">Some task managers (like <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>) ask you to choose between these types of projects when setting things up. But if you’re just getting started, you don’t really need to worry about these just yet. Just know that at some point you <em>may</em> encounter a project with tasks that are dependent on the outcomes of other tasks within the same project (these are sequential projects).</p><h3 id="6780df39-8c5d-4b83-aaae-10bc684be037" class="">What is the difference between a due and a start date?</h3><p id="d6892953-21ee-4c54-829e-a854f097439b" class="">Once you get rolling with task management, you’ll quickly encounter a concept called <em>due dates</em>. A due date is exactly what it sounds like: a date that the task or project must be completed by. For example, our podcasts are always released on Monday mornings at 7am Eastern Time. That means everything <em>MUST</em> be ready to go by Monday at 7am (the due date).</p><p id="249753f2-c87d-40ef-8d6b-f53552bbdfe7" class="">Some more sophisticated task management systems also introduce the concept of <em>start dates</em> (or defer dates). These are completely different (and often better). Instead of telling you when a task or project is <em>due</em>, they indicate that the task or project is able to be worked on (or started). This is handy for bigger projects that you don’t want to leave for the last minute but you don’t want to worry about right now. For example, I’m speaking at the <a href="https://macstockconferenceandexpo.com/">Macstock Conference and Expo </a>this summer and I need to prepare my talk. I don’t want to worry about the talk right now, but I don’t want to wait until July to start preparing either. So I might create a project for creating my presentation and put a start date of June 1. This gives me plenty of time to work on it, but my task management system won’t bug me until I want to start thinking about it.</p><h2 id="aceff513-487d-47c7-a408-8f2af2ced466" class="">AE’s Hierarchy of Task Management Needs</h2><p id="20fab965-a179-4bb1-b5aa-14209da2a02f" class="">Now that we’ve covered there basic terms you need to know to start managing your tasks, let’s take a look at the different options that are available. But before we do, I’m going to make an outrageous claim:</p><p id="4f564163-1dc5-4836-8441-d65fd7584453" class=""><em>The tools you use don’t matter.</em></p><p id="db03f8c8-e329-4044-8644-3e72bc713fc0" class="">Many people think it’s the fact that they don’t have a particular tool that is holding them back. That’s simply not true. Tools are force multipliers for your methods. So for many who don’t know what they’re doing, the tools just amplify the fact that they don’t know what they’re doing. They’re reproducing chaos inside of the task management system. You need to have the right mindset before the tools can help. You have to think right about your tasks before a powerful task management app can help you stay on top of them. Task managers are great because they can show you the right tasks at the right time, but they’ll only do that if you know how to set it up the right way. If you put garbage into a tool like <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>, you’ll get garbage out. So don’t skip ahead – stick with me and get a firm grasp on these task management basics. If you can master these basic principles, you’ll be able to scale up effectiveness instead of anarchy when you use technology to do some of the heavy lifting.</p><p id="8925851b-2b9b-4f50-ae97-426b9113d6a4" class="">As you progress on your task management journey and you are forced to balance more tasks, your approach to task management <em>will</em> change. More complex and powerful tools bring efficiency, but require more upkeep and attention in order to leverage the benefits they provide. Here’s a visual diagram of the basic task management systems that are available:</p><figure id="d098b1ce-5f2f-49d6-95f2-488e26e59ebe" class="image"><a href="%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E4%BB%BB%E4%BD%95%E4%BB%BB%E5%8A%A1%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%AE%9E%E7%8E%B0%E6%82%A8%E7%9A%84%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%20a9627c74d5994490b037cef58f05fe0a/task-system-hierarchy.png"><img style="width:700px" src="%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E4%BB%BB%E4%BD%95%E4%BB%BB%E5%8A%A1%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%AE%9E%E7%8E%B0%E6%82%A8%E7%9A%84%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%20a9627c74d5994490b037cef58f05fe0a/task-system-hierarchy.png"/></a></figure><p id="b44c07c0-20f5-4ee1-8c94-8a5c01d1dd14" class="">Keep in mind that your task management system should reflect the level of complexity you need to successfully stay on top of everything you have to do. The simplest solution is your <strong>best</strong> solution. Stick with what works. It can be tempting to chase the “shiny new object,” but only do so when you are feeling the pain of the current limitations inherent in your current system. In other words, when you know you need your system to do something else, <em>then</em> look to upgrade. Many people buy something like <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> or <a href="https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/things-site/">Things</a> and never use it because they don’t understand how to make it work for them. They don’t understand why they should use it or what it’s good at, they just heard someone recommend it. The more powerful the tool you decide to use, the more complexity is required to make it work <em>correctly</em>. You need to understand what you’re signing up for before you drop the $50 on a sophisticated piece of software.</p><p id="a969f2e8-b0ba-47dd-a7d2-a8107c80ef1c" class="">Now that we’ve warned you that just getting a powerful tool doesn’t guarantee success, let’s take a look at what the different “levels” of task management all have in common.</p><h2 id="d1a7880e-0efa-42e6-8d76-8be844ba0366" class="">2 Things Every Task Management System MUST Have</h2><p id="33ecc6d5-1b76-468f-848c-db4e04a1d7a1" class="">There are many different features available for the task management systems we’re about to list here, but you really only need 2 things to get started:</p><ol type="1" id="3b4973cf-52e1-4856-8aac-7102b77f50c4" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>A list of the things you want to work on</li></ol><ol type="1" id="814d2eb5-9082-446b-b700-a8e8ea742f9c" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>A way to capture new tasks as you become aware of them</li></ol><p id="d9bf8e0e-f7f2-4b7b-b0b2-ac0b4704d36c" class="">Don’t overlook the importance of capture. You <em>need</em> a way to write down things as you are thinking about them. If you try to keep it all in your head, you’ll 1) forget most of what you need to do, and 2) you’ll be incredibly stressed. David Allen, the author of <a href="https://www.asianefficiency.com/task-management/gtd-intro/">Getting Things Done</a>, said it this way:</p><blockquote id="dbb5ecbc-48b8-4b55-b765-63e845deb189" class="">“Your brain is for having ideas, not for holding them.”</blockquote><p id="3c32416c-a1cc-4278-b55f-e5f1ae270c99" class="">Trust me on this – you’re not as smart as you think you are. You can’t remember all the important things you need to do today.

It may not be complicated, but that’s the beauty of it. Oftentimes, just stopping to think for a minute and making a simple list of what you need to get done provides enough direction to get started. The benefits of paper are that is very simple, and it’s <em>extremely</em> flexible. You don’t need to know anything about productivity systems to start getting the benefit of working from a simple list.</p><p id="9311aab3-b4da-4fc2-a066-58f56ffad98c" class="">Getting this system started is extremely simple – just make a list of the 5 things you absolutely want to get done today. Put them in the order you want to complete them and cross them off the list as you get them done. It sounds too simple to be effective, but I know many people who actually moved away from complex task management systems because they find these simple lists more effective. When you don’t have a complex system to fiddle with, you are free to focus on doing the actual work.</p><p id="e3f48974-98b8-4a70-92fb-87079ba11378" class="">That’s not to say there aren’t downsides compared to other task management systems.

The problem is that you need to add additional information to your tasks in order for this to work.

The bigger or less defined the task is, the higher the tendency to procrastinate. You <em>MUST</em> break down your tasks as far as you logically can and clearly define the work. This does two things:</p><ol type="1" id="18e2c461-effb-476c-b059-20fc2ecbdef3" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>It helps you think through all the requirements of the task or project, eliminating surprises that make it take longer than you thought.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="8599d8ae-1de6-4278-841b-62dc9b245b39" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>It minimizes the amount of activation energy required to start working on the task.</li></ol><p id="8779e029-2a17-47ae-b2a3-f11d2873f0eb" class="">Many times procrastination is caused by having to do work before the work. In other words, we have to figure out what to do or where to start. But when you break your tasks down, you eliminate this. Your tasks are simple, and it’s easier to get started on them because you know exactly what you’re getting into. And since it’s small, it doesn’t take a huge commitment to get rolling with it.</p><h3 id="2aef6b2d-b728-4e53-97c9-71f03f54371f" class="">#2: Write for Your Future Self</h3><p id="1df493dd-d67a-48f9-b03f-bf1e11ec92b1" class="">This is another mistake that we see people make all the time – they don’t write for their future selves. Let me blunt: future you is an idiot. He or she has no idea what you’re thinking right now. And if you assume that future you will have the same reference point when it’s time to work on your task, you are mistaken. That’s why you need to write your tasks in a way that future you knows <em>exactly</em> what to do.</p><p id="27d2d109-ec3c-4cd1-9114-4c72488307e0" class="">The best way to do this is to be as clear as possible when writing your tasks and to start with a verb. For example, “Mom’s birthday” is a bad task name. What does this mean? Am I supposed to call my mom on her birthday? Or was I supposed to send her a gift last week? Am I supposed to plan her surprise party? The ambiguity causes me to not want to do anything with this. Even though I know it’s important (it’s my mom’s birthday!) I don’t know what I can do to complete the task, so I’ll tend to avoid it.</p><p id="006320ee-1c8e-42ac-b9b6-20cfe33da39b" class="">A better task name would be “Call mom and wish her a happy birthday.” Or “Order mom’s birthday gift from Amazon.” Both of these make it very clear what needs to be done. It’s so simple, even future me can do it.</p><h3 id="1b94c50e-7b48-42d4-8bc8-61bdbbe8ac5d" class="">#3: Use Start Dates Instead of Due Dates Whenever Possible</h3><p id="200d361b-d3d5-47a7-aee4-b8fc4193cfbe" class="">As we mentioned earlier, you want to avoid arbitrary due dates. I can’t stress this enough:</p><blockquote id="a9b0bae0-1798-473c-b2a5-89aed05c5463" class="">Only use due dates when they are required!</blockquote><p id="d416f5a3-a693-4b1a-81a1-2144c9c428d0" class="">If you use due dates for <em>ALL</em> your tasks, here’s exactly what will happen:</p><ol type="1" id="b95a25ad-c8a5-42d5-a41e-f3f173e3f0f6" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>You’ll end up with a bunch of things that are “overdue” but you won’t know which ones are <em>really</em> overdue and which ones are just screaming at you for attention.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="5a0262ea-6728-417d-819d-a6f6153e77a1" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>You’ll start feeling overwhelmed because no matter how effective you are, you still have a bunch of “overdue” tasks.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="71cc0093-b635-47bb-bb29-41b56d5c17b4" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li>You’ll start not to trust your task management system since it’s hard for you to discern what’s really important and should be worked on right now.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="7f59cea8-b8fd-45ed-9c26-6bc11f5dc099" class="numbered-list" start="4"><li>You’ll stop using it altogether.</li></ol><p id="0fb75e71-7f14-4672-9ee6-395f7229f45b" class="">We’ve seen this cycle hundreds if not thousands of times. A better approach (if your task management system supports is) is to use start dates instead.</p><p id="9974357f-958d-4d95-b37a-fe3c15380320" class="">Start dates (or defer dates) tell your task management system when a task is available to be worked on. This is great when you want to generally start thinking about a task or project but it doesn’t need to be done by a specific date. Using start dates allows your digital task management system to filter out all the tasks you shouldn’t even be thinking about right now automatically. This means that when you are going through your system and selecting tasks to work on, you only see a small (but relevant) subset of your tasks – the ones you <em>should</em> be looking at. All the other tasks that don’t really matter are hidden, eliminating digital clutter and helping you to focus.</p><p id="490db77e-6547-40c9-9145-3599249c32c3" class="">By the way, start dates and due dates are not mutually exclusive. It’s possible to have a task with both a start date <em>and</em> a due date. But as a general practice, don’t just fill in the due date field with when you <em>think</em> a task <strong>might</strong> be due. Use a start date instead.</p><h3 id="cc020259-68cc-481d-b90f-d853bbe06a78" class="">#4: Focus on One Thing at a Time</h3><p id="255c6acc-0eb6-40be-ae84-fb3b0fe139e2" class="">Thinking about the next task on your list or the meeting coming up in an hour won’t help you get your work done on this task any fast – in fact, it will make it take longer! Don’t look ahead or try to do more than you are capable of. Multitasking is a myth. You’ll be much better off if you focus on one thing at a time when working on your tasks and projects.</p><p id="2752a4fc-94f7-49bb-8ab2-a106f1fdfef8" class="">I know this is easier said than done, but you need to fight against this with every fibre of your being. If you want to be effective, you have to block out your list and laser-focus on one specific thing. If you need a little help, try using the <a href="https://www.asianefficiency.com/motivation/become-more-productive-with-the-pomodoro-technique/">Pomodoro method to block out distractions</a>.</p><h3 id="84b0be65-bf38-4057-a3ba-bc1206eb83f6" class="">#5: Do the Hardest Thing First</h3><p id="ab24546b-8852-49ee-9aae-96f6cf1e6b61" class="">You should do your most important tasks (MITs) early on in the day. This is when you have the most mental horsepower and it can help you overcome the procrastination associated with large or difficult tasks. This concept is called <a href="https://www.asianefficiency.com/habits/eat-that-frog-most-important-tasks-morning/">eating your frog</a>, an awesome idea we picked up from author Brian Tracy. The original quote from Mark Twain goes:</p><blockquote id="5ddb97ce-3877-48bf-bfbb-666cc24b7d10" class="">“Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.”</blockquote><p id="c3339596-5c29-4e79-9d5f-6700313f5e6a" class="">From a productivity perspective, this means that you should do the big things that you tend to procrastinate on early in the day. If you do, you’ll be able to go through the rest of your day with the satisfaction that at least you took action on your MITs. Even if the rest of your day get derailed, you’ll have eaten your frog and been productive.</p><h3 id="1b0fd100-3d06-4f21-aae5-8d24720f0897" class="">#6: Put First Things First</h3><p id="df8a304a-8cee-4587-93e1-a976fdd4b7a9" class="">Your task management system should be a reflection of your priorities. If something is important to you, then you should make sure it shows up on your task list. There’s a story made popular by author Stephen Covey in the book <a href="https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/first-things-first/">First Things First</a> that illustrates the importance of creating time for the important things in your life. The story goes something like this…</p><p id="32f6ef9c-2db7-4d9c-8156-36fdd6f0a465" class="">A professor once pulled out a one-gallon, wide-mouthed mason jar and set it on a table in front of his class. Then he produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and carefully placed them, one at a time, into the jar.</p><p id="b0cfb1fc-0913-4939-8ba1-93a95c2a43bb" class="">￼</p><p id="b125276b-ec42-4f6d-8c20-a6f90c25a3af" class="">When the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would fit inside, he asked his class, “Is this jar full?” Everyone in the class said, “Yes.” Then he reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel. Then he dumped some gravel in and shook the jar causing pieces of gravel to work themselves down into the spaces between the big rocks.</p><p id="5f501bbb-8be3-4f9b-a49d-aad850933870" class="">Then he smiled and asked the group once more, “Is the jar full?” By this time the class was onto him. “Probably not,” one of them answered. “Good!” he replied. And he reached under the table and brought out a bucket of sand. He started dumping the sand in and it filled all the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel. Once more he asked the question, “Is this jar full?”</p><p id="edc0565b-2c82-42dd-b456-e7e332f9dc60" class="">“No!” the class responded. Once again he said, “Good!” Then he grabbed a pitcher of water and began to pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim. Then he looked up at the class and asked, “What is the point of all this?”</p><p id="e15d68bc-c698-4627-a3e7-3e4a96df0405" class="">One person responded that there is always time you can squeeze in a day. While that is true, it was not the point the professor wanted to get across.</p><p id="79dcb332-ecfe-4f1a-a817-2ecea5aeb32f" class="">“The point,” he said, “is that if you don’t put the big rocks in there first, you will not be able to get them in at all.”</p><h3 id="b41a6b53-2a2a-4d15-9a19-08506aae746b" class="">#7: Schedule Your Important Tasks</h3><p id="347022d1-43e4-4ca1-a3fc-b02cf038b4a2" class="">One of the best ways to put first things first and carve out time for your big rocks is to put those tasks on your calendar. But only as an exception, not as a rule. In fact, you usually <em>don’t</em> want to put your tasks on your calendar. In the post titled <a href="https://www.asianefficiency.com/schedule-management/how-to-use-a-calendar-and-task-manager-together/">How to Use a Calendar &amp; Task Manager Together</a>, I said it this way:</p><blockquote id="70be6cb7-5ab3-4930-9207-4e15a141d1a1" class="">Nothing goes on your calendar unless it’s a must and is time sensitive. You absolutely want to avoid putting tasks on your calendar that have random or arbitrary deadlines.</blockquote><p id="5ff5ea2a-944b-4f72-8dc2-b2cfe3bbc43b" class="">When you put something on your calendar, you are indeed creating an arbitrary deadline for it. As we mentioned earlier, this is generally a bad idea. But when you absolutely want to make sure you have time to work on this task because it’s really important, then putting it on your calendar can be a very effective way to make sure you have the time to work on it.</p><p id="bcb981a7-e816-40de-8fc5-f8bab10eeefa" class="">Just make sure you only do this occasionally, and <a href="https://www.asianefficiency.com/schedule-management/why-you-need-to-color-code-your-calendar/">only for your most important tasks</a>. The task must be a priority. But when everything is a priority, that really just means that nothing is.</p><h3 id="d54279ce-d7f9-46ac-ad8f-15ccbb91d28b" class="">#8: REVIEW!!!</h3><p id="1851d36b-cacd-4cf8-905d-d1c3a567e12f" class="">No matter what task management system you decide to use, make sure that you review it regularly. Whenever someone says they tried task management and it didn’t work for them, it’s usually because they didn’t review their tasks regularly. By failing to review consistently, they just let things pile up and it gets harder and harder to keep up with their system. They can get the system set up, but then they try to “set it and forget it” and they don’t maintain it. When it comes to your productivity though, you need to be consistently reviewing and making adjustments. It’s important to clean up and update your lists, dump any new loose ends into your trusted system, and clear your mind so everything can run smoothly. At Asian Efficiency, we recommend that you do this weekly. Yes, it takes a little bit of time, but the benefit of feeling like you’re finally in control of your life by far outweighs the cost.</p><h2 id="36ebef6d-b945-41d4-8c06-29c7b345111b" class="">Conclusion</h2><p id="4d0b5107-7b46-4b37-90a9-12568cc43a3a" class="">If I were to sum up the advice in this article, it would be this:</p><ol type="1" id="97f8ea4d-afff-409c-baca-2eacfe013985" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Figure out what you kind of tool you need for making your list every day</li></ol><ol type="1" id="573af61e-ef4b-4067-b9db-332bd0b0785e" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>Identify a way to capture new tasks as you become aware of them</li></ol><p id="275f4680-a956-4136-bfbc-5ecf253305c7" class="">If you’re starting from scratch, start with pen and paper. If you are bumping into the limitations of your current task system, take a look at the 5 levels of task management systems we covered in this article. Be careful: the more your task management system can do, the more attention it will require from you to keep it running.</p><p id="a724c480-fab2-4b8a-b16f-db72111ede9c" class="">The bottom line is that there is no one right approach to task management. You have to figure out what works for <em>YOU</em>. But that doesn’t mean that you need to spend a ton of time trying to figure it all out for yourself.
