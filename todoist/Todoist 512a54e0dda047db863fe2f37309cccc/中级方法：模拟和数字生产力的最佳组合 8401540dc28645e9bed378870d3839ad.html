It turns out, the vast majority of us are actually incapable of multitasking. What we refer to as “multitasking” is actually our brain <a href="https://blog.doist.com/context-switching/">context switching</a> — jumping rapidly back and forth between tasks, which burns this same oxygenated glucose at monstrous rates, leading us into energy nosedives mid-afternoon.

Pick your favorite. Any one will do. I prefer hard-bound notebooks for preservation purposes. Currently I’m using a ruled <a href="http://www.midori-japan.co.jp/md/en/products/notebook.html">Midori MD</a> notebook, but don’t get caught up in the minute differences between all of the brands available. I continually jump brands to avoid the time wasting trap of picking “the best.” What you put inside a notebook is sacred; not the notebook itself.</p><p id="f9d8db57-0607-445c-8b3b-e13c2d7a5fbb" class="">This notebook is what I work out of during the day. It sits open on my desk collecting everything. It’s a task collector, a scrapbook (daily comic strips often find their way in), an event grabber, a notepad, a sketchbook, a journal and <a href="http://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/">a commonplace book</a> (for gathering quotes and notes from what I read, like and learn.) <em>This</em> is the notebook’s dedicated purpose.</p><p id="5faadc54-d6c4-4139-b44b-38fdfd72b456" class="">I don’t use a strict format, or stick to a legend of symbols. Though I find pre-formatted notebooks like <a href="http://www.theghostlystore.com/collections/behance-action-method">The Action Method</a> and <a href="http://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-planner/">Emergent Task</a> appealing, ultimately I find the freedom to adapt far more valuable. Every day is a different day and each may require a different format. I simply stamp the date at the top of a new page and spill into the book until it’s time for bed.</p><p id="d9b870f1-8902-477f-b5d9-6246b899b734" class="">(For those of you who like a more structured approach to organizing your notebook, you might want to try the Bullet journal or <a href="http://striketh.ru/#welcome">Strikethrough method</a>. Productivity writer and fellow Todoist blog contributor Belle Beth Cooper recently wrote about her own <a href="http://blog.bellebethcooper.com/todoist.html">modified notebook system</a>).</p><h3 id="c2fce773-133a-4a15-97a3-7298bbf9a36d" class="">Your travel notebook</h3><p id="8f9c7c9d-8bcd-4a8d-9284-276bbf13613a" class="">As you can imagine, the main notebook is of utmost importance. It’s not something that I want to lose, and it’s too bulky to carry with me every time that I leave the house. For this purpose, I prefer a pocket notebook, something small and thin that doesn’t make my jeans awkwardly bulge. Right now, I prefer the Midori Travelers Notebook in passport size with one insert (but as I said before, don’t get caught up on the tools. Any pocket notebook will do).</p><p id="b3593816-b52c-4227-9774-5242535a77f7" class="">The only purpose of <em>this</em> notebook is to grab stuff on the go. I chose the Midori because the leather cover keeps the paper from being demolished in my pocket, the elastic strap is convenient for holding my pen, and all of the pages are perforated for easy removal. And as much as I hate ballpoint pens, I use a Fisher Space Pen Bullet because it’s small and I know it will write in almost any circumstance.</p><p id="8ec983cb-cb89-40dd-ad7c-87b98005c3b8" class="">When I get back to my desk from a meeting, coffee, lunch or whatever has driven me into the world of the living, I copy my pocket notes into my main notebook. This isn’t a necessary step for the system, but I find that it refocuses me before diving back into whatever I’m working on. I also prefer to have all of my notes in the full-sized notebook, because as a habit, I read these notebooks years later in order to remember forgotten ideas, thoughts, concepts, books and films. I also find that re-reading my old notebooks gives me a greater sense of accomplishment and gratitude.</p><h3 id="f43ca49a-8419-4b8f-a9e1-51f0cd2ec46b" class="">The nightly review</h3><p id="6fe529e3-21a8-4ac7-90b8-eedc8ada36d2" class="">At the end of each day, I do a nightly transcription and review. This is when I open my notebook and look at everything that I’ve collected from the day, and begin to process it. I look for any future events and add them to my online calendar. I look for all completed tasks on my daily post-it (more on this in a bit) and mark them complete in Todoist. I also add any new tasks from my notebook into Todoist, assigning all appropriate dates, notes and tags. I then look into my online calendar to see what I have scheduled for the next day, and I add those appointments to my post-it, followed by my top three tasks from Todoist.</p><h3 id="10995155-a9b7-4eed-856a-541739f5903d" class="">A daily Post-It note</h3><p id="cca73188-5e57-42d3-8e9f-e4262cd3d129" class="">Why a post-it? Simply put, I find post-its are the hardest to ignore. I stick the day’s post-it to the next new page in my notebook and this forces me to stare at it all day as I am writing. If something is incredibly urgent I can stick the post-it to the screen of my computer or my phone or the front door. When I leave my desk, it’s just as easy to grab that little neon square and stick it inside of my pocket notebook. I also find that the limited space of the post-it forces focus. The post-it requires me to be aware of priority when making the list, and it allows me to see nothing but those three tasks throughout the day.</p><p id="44073349-a3f9-4d0c-ab14-4c16881dae64" class="">Often, while working, we allow incoming tasks to deter us from our most important daily goals. The Medium Method makes getting derailed more difficult. It’s hard to squeeze another task onto my post-it. If I’m going to squeeze a new task into my day, I have to really want to. Otherwise, if the task doesn’t qualify, it goes into my main notebook for Todoist entry later that evening.</p><p id="ed648182-ddce-4bed-8929-ef68f42e34ba" class="">The post-it also affords me the psychological satisfaction of crossing out a completed task. If at the end of the day, I’ve completed all three tasks I can crinkle the post-it up into a ball and shoot for the bin. If I’ve failed to complete all three, I carry the post-it over to the next day. And trust me, from experience, two post-it days suck and should be avoided at all costs.</p><h3 id="a4bcb1c3-a2df-4707-b88f-7671b464b590" class="">Long-term digital storage</h3><p id="2b3f092e-07ce-4abe-96c2-49626dc18fcb" class="">The last thing I do every day is copy all of my notes into OneNote (you can just as easily use Evernote or Google Keep.) All notes on movies, books, albums, etc. go into a notebook called “Commonplace.” This affords me the ability to utilize quick search in the future when needing information. I can also link notes to each other as I begin to see how new notes relate with older notes.</p><p id="2a308c22-b9bc-4324-b727-fe2ac5f19164" class="">In OneNote, I have another notebook called “Journal.” In this notebook, I have sections for each month and in these sections are pages for each day. Here, I copy every important event that occurs during the day. While separated by day and month, I do not separate my journal pages by year. This means, for example, that my Dec 4th page has notes from 2015, 2014, and any other years for which I have notes.</p><p id="258fb212-fdec-4b00-8f77-020e6d47e079" class="">Using One Note.</p><p id="ef911e45-f538-48ca-8134-83b2692294eb" class="">When I copy the current notes into the journal each day, I can then be reminded of what happened on this same day in the past. The most important part of this process is that it allows me to search for past events. Past events aren’t something that we think of often when creating productivity systems, but wouldn’t it be useful to have access to this type of information when we need it? Wouldn’t it be nice to know: What day was that meeting? What was the name of that person that I met at the last networking event? What did we talk about? What was that restaurant we went to in Switzerland called? When did I buy my laptop? When does that warranty expire?</p><p id="4e2542aa-c893-49bf-b09f-17558904fbee" class="">I even find that this nightly review is useful for social media. Did I think of anything short and funny today? Save that for Twitter tomorrow. Did I make any doodles or sketches that I like? Save that for Instagram. What concept from the book I’m reading stuck out as the most impactful? Save that to discuss in my Snapchat story for the next day.</p><h2 id="b89e34d4-4e30-4a05-82a4-9cfb70516c78" class="">Using desirable difficulty for learning and creativity</h2><p id="980fe8d3-ce60-4655-a58b-4c882c82a21a" class="">This hybrid workflow may seem unnecessarily complicated (after all, you’re basically capturing everything twice — sometimes more.) But in practice it’s completely intuitive. You’re using things in a way that plays to their strengths and minimizes their shortcomings.</p><p id="dec03850-9f9b-4786-9b68-c31d0a03a6ca" class="">It’s faster and more natural to jot something down on paper rather than switching to the right app or firing up your computer, and you won’t get distracted by notifications along the way. It’s easier and much more visible to stick a post-it somewhere than it is to remember to look at an app or device that requires opening.</p><p id="c3d34026-128d-4682-82b6-6c5ab535a875" class="">On the other hand, it’s easier to search for information on a computer than it is to thumb through notebooks and pages. It’s easier to be automatically notified of events and due dates with reminders from Google Calendar or Todoist than it is to go back and find those notes in your paper notebook. And it will always be easier to share information and collaborate with colleagues by adding attachments and comments than it is to photocopy your notes and expect someone to decipher your hand-writing.</p><p id="7857d7de-ae75-45b8-8b50-05636a4952eb" class="">A nightly review may seem time-consuming and redundant, but in reality it only takes about 15-30 minutes and it refreshes all of that information in my mind at the end of the day, prepping it for my brain to move into long-term storage.</p><p id="a41bb5bd-1f33-4e7a-a32a-322ccae0d2c1" class="">This is what Dr. Robert Bjork refers to as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desirable_difficulty">desirable difficulty</a>”; he’s found that the difficulties of certain activities, such as copying notes, actually enhances not only memory but enables us to more easily make connections between different bits of information. As Dr. Bjork says:</p><blockquote id="e676cfda-b1c7-43b7-8827-b83797bb2178" class="">We encode and store new information by relating it to what we already know — that is, by mapping it onto, and linking it up with, information that already exists in our memories.</blockquote><p id="6d3213af-5f7a-432c-b927-52d28c34521a" class="">The Medium Method relies on desirable difficulty and re-enforces not only the benefits of paper and digital but also takes advantage of how our brains actually work to spur deeper learning and creativity.</p><p id="c2d0f9fc-c6a0-4d4d-9884-979a33de7d8e" class="">For me, The Medium Method is much more than a productivity system; it’s a system of organization, an education amplifier, and a lifestyle enhancer. In the short time that I’ve used it, I find that I’m more focused, productive, organized, and informed. I’m less stressed, and I sleep better. Most importantly, with The Medium Method, I’m happier and more satisfied in my life and work overall.</p></div></article></body></html>
